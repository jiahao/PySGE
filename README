About
-----
These files provide low level routines to interface Python code with a
Grid Engine-compatible batch job scheduler.

The purpose of this is to abstract away the direct calling of the Grid Engine
command-line utility *qsub*  from within a Python script, but to provide nonetheless
a faithful mapping of all its available options.

Example
-------
    x = SGE.qsubOptions()
    x.args.N = 'MyJobName' # Name of Grid Engine job
    x.args.t = '1-20'      # Define an array job with 20 subjobs
    x.args.p = '-500'      # Set priority to -500
    x.args.o = '$JOB_NAME.$JOB_ID.$TASK_ID.stdout.log'.replace('$', '\$') #Set output for each array job
    x.args.command = 'mycmd'
    x.args.b = 'y'         # This is a binary file 
    print '#To submit the array job, run this command:'
    x.execute(mode = 'echo')

Note
----
These routines were tested on Sun Grid Engine 6.2.
